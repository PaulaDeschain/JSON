# JSON
Juan is in charge of doing the shopping at home, so he often checks the sales catalogs of the different supermarkets near his home in order to save a few euros at the end of the month.

Juan would like to have his shopping list in the different supermarkets in a structured way, since he is thinking of developing a web application that displays this information.

Our job is to help Juan in this task by defining his shopping list in JSON format, in the most detailed way possible, identifying each supermarket with its products, offers, validity period, common consumer products without offer, units, unit measurement, price, etc., and that this format also allows marking whether the product has been purchased or not, since when Juan has his web application he will use it regularly in the supermarket.

Regarding the information of the different supermarkets, it would be interesting to know some basic information, name, address and geolocation, which later allows the web application to provide additional functionalities.

Finally, since John hasn't settled on a standard yet, he'll also need to have an example from a particular supermarket in XML format.
